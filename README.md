# LocalFood
I'd like to introduce my new project!
In this app i used Firebase, SwiftUI and some CoreLocation to know current user's postion.
This project helps users to order food from restaurant in short time.
User add food in the cart and make an order. Order goes to Firebase, where we can handle its.
